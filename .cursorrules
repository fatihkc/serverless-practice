# Coding Guidelines

USE CONTEXT7

## Python Development
- Use Python 3.11+ with type hints for all function signatures
- Use Flask for REST APIs with proper request validation and error handling
- Use boto3 for all AWS SDK operations
- Follow PEP 8 style guide strictly
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use async/await for I/O operations where possible
- Always include docstrings for functions and classes (Google style)

## Flask Specific
- Use Flask blueprints for logical route organization
- Implement proper error handling with abort() and custom error handlers
- Use jsonify() for all JSON responses
- Validate request data with request.get_json() and manual checks
- Add proper logging with Flask's logger or Python's logging module

## AWS & Infrastructure
- boto3: Always handle ClientError exceptions
- DynamoDB: Use resource interface for simpler operations
- CloudWatch: Log structured JSON for better querying
- Environment variables: Use for all configuration (no hardcoded values)

## Terraform
- Use consistent naming: kebab-case for resource names, snake_case for variables
- Always add descriptions to variables and outputs
- Use data sources to reference existing resources
- Tag all resources with environment, project, and managed-by tags
- Separate resources into logical files (networking, compute, storage)
- Use variables for all configurable values

## Docker
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Run as non-root user when possible
- Use specific base image versions (no 'latest' tag)
- Minimize layers by combining RUN commands
- Add .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files

## IAM & Security
- Follow principle of least privilege for all IAM roles
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for sensitive data
- Restrict security group rules to minimum required access
- Enable encryption at rest for all data stores

## Error Handling & Logging
- Always include try-except blocks for external calls
- Log errors with context (request ID, user ID, etc.)
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Return meaningful error messages to clients
- Never expose internal errors to API responses

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use pytest as test framework
- Mock AWS services with moto library
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test both success and error cases

## Git & Version Control
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use conventional commits format: type(scope): message
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Never commit sensitive data or credentials

## Code Quality
- Use type hints throughout
- Avoid deeply nested code (max 3 levels)
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable names (no single letters except in comprehensions)
- Add comments for complex logic only
- Prefer readability over cleverness

# Documentation Guidelines

- DO NOT USE EMOJIS
